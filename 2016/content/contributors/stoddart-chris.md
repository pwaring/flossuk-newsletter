**Chris Stoddart** started programming seriously during his physics degree when
he re-wrote the software that interfaced an X-ray diffractometer to a BBC micro.
He was introduced to UNIX sysadminning during his PhD when he was somehow left
in charge of the Sun workstations. Since then heâ€™s looked after Vaxen at
Bradford University, Alphas at The Open University and currently takes care of
the server room for the Department of Computer Science at Sheffield University.
