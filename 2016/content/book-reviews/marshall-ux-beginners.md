There’s a lot to like about this book, but also things you might dislike. The genesis of
the book was an internal mailing list, and then a blog, and then an email-based short
course, and these lead to the 100 short lessons of the title. Mostly these are one or
two pages of text with a small number running over more, though these usually
contain several illustrations rather than more words. The aim is to cover every aspect
of UX at some level and the book definitely does that, giving sound information and
with illustrative stories from the author’s own experiences. There’s lots of good
background information drawn from psychology and HCI research, all of it presented in
digestible chunks that don’t demand previous technical knowledge. The more
design-oriented sections work in the same way, presenting the bits of standard graphic design
knowledge that are relevant. There’s useful material on content creation,
measurement and business aspects as well.

So, overall it looks good and does what it says on the cover, but as I said above, there
are things about it that you just might not like (as always your mileage may vary!). First
off, the book is landscape format rather than portrait so if you have narrow shelves it
will stick out awkwardly: a minor issue I know, but potentially annoying. The book is
profusely illustrated, and if you don’t mind the style used then you’ll have no problem,
but, personally, I didn’t like it at all and found it put me off. The writing style is light
and tries to be slightly jokey - I wasn’t amused though and found it a bit wearing after a
while: what may work well in email messages that arrive over a period of time doesn’t
feel right for the flow of a book. Some other reviewers did not like the language used
and thought the book inappropriate for a business environment. Flow  is also a
problem with the 100 short lessons. There are lots of books that are split up into short
sections - one of the best (that everyone should own) is Universal Principles of Design -
but where this works best is where the sections do not directly relate. In UX for
Beginners there is necessarily a flow through the sections and some are so short that it
just starts to feel bitty. You would think you could dip in and out, but you can’t. From a
technical standpoint though the coverage and ideas are fine, but I would have liked to
see more coverage of accessibility - the section on it is very weak indeed - and I would
also have liked to see many more pointers to places that I could read about a topic in
depth. You don’t stay a beginner forever and you want ways to move on.

All that being said, I would probably recommend this book to my students as an all-
round introduction, but at at nearly £20, very few of them would take it up. Pricing is
part of UX too.
