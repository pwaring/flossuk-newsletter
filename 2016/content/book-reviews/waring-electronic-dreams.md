*Disclosure: I was at university with the author of Electronic Dreams - though
I still had to pay full price for my copy of the book!*

Most of the books reviewed for the newsletter are hot off the press and relate
to the latest tools and languages, such as C11, ES6, Swift etc. Occasionally
though it's fun to take a trip down memory lane and reminisce about the 'good
old days' -- in this case 1980s computing.

The first thing I noticed about this book is that Tom has done his research, no
doubt assisted by his current project involving conducting interviews with figures
from science and techology, including Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson. Many of
the interviewees are refreshingly frank about topics such as the (un)reliability
of the computers and the 'flying by the seat of our pants' method of running a
computer-related business in the 1980s. My favourite anecdote though is
the one where Furber and Wilson are separately told that the other has said
it would be possible to have a prototype ready by the end of the week, as a way
of spurring them on.

Even though I have read widely about the period in question, there were still
some new facts and tidbits to enjoy. For example, I'd somehow managed to miss
Prestel, the Post Office system which could be seen as an early version of
the World Wide Web. Also, whilst the information on the Acorn, Spectrum and
Commodore machines didn't cover anytthing new to me, the Oric computer was
something which I hadn't heard of before.

After reading this book I had mixed feelings about the subject matter -- pride
that Britain was a pioneer in the field of computing, and disappointment
that we failed to follow up on early successes and instead left it to the
United States to lead the world. Even where we have succeeded, it's often
'behind the scenes' and uncredited (e.g. both the iPhone and iPad use hardware
designed by UK companies ARM and Imagination Technologies). Hopefully this book
will go some way to spreading the word about historical British contribution to
computing, and perhaps even spur on the next generation.

If you have any interest in the history of computing, this book is well worth
reading. Tom has managed to tell an interesting story without resorting to
hundreds of footnotes -- something which academics writing books aimed at a
wider audience sometimes fall down on.
