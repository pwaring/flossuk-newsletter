# Cooking for Geeks, 2nd Edition

## Nigel Barker

Do cookery and geekery go hand in hand? O'Reilly think so and indeed the first edition of this book sold more than 100,000 copies. I fit in that target demographic, but although the book was on my wants list, I never actually picked one up until this second edition which comes with 150 pages of new material.

As I expected there is a lot to like about this book. It's added to my wealth of trivia, e.g. the origin of the word restaurant, and it's made me curious about cooking a number of things I hadn't considered before, like endive, edamame, kale chips and zabaglione.

Chapters are based on science ideas, so recipes don't follow in the usual cookbook order of breakfasts, soups, starters, main dishes etc. Instead the chapters cover taste, time and temperature, air and water, chemicals and, the one I thought was most fun, hardware (pressure cooking, sous vide, fast freezing etc.). Each chapter has theory, experiments, interviews and recipes.

Some of the recipes seem a bit simple compared to other cookbooks, I guess this is because they are intended as starting points to illustrate a particular idea rather than fully finished recipes for successful entertaining.

There are tips that are new to me, like cutting tomatoes with a bread knife, and science which I hadn't read before, like the actual definition of the Scoville scale. There is a handy cooking personality quiz in the introduction â€“ I'm a methodical cook whereas my wife is a giving cook.

My family are vegetarian so lots of stuff about meat temperatures wasn't really relevant to my cooking but I was still interested in the information about safety and bacteria.

My only gripe is that this is an American book and the cultural differences show. Quantities are given in grams as well as cups, but us Brits have to remember a barbecue is called a grill while a grill is a broiler. And what the heck are Snickerdoodles?
