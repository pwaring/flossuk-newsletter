# Information Architecture, 4th Edition

## Lindsay Marshall

I’m pretty sure I reviewed the first edition of this book back in 1998, but  the
architecture of my information archive is such that I can’t easily locate that text -
clearly, I should have read it more thoroughly! However, I do recall that I thought the
book was excellent then, and that is still true now. The material is up to date and
shows the experience of nearly twenty years of development and expansion.

The books is in three parts, with the first providing an overview of the fundamental
concepts that underly the field, focussing on the importance of finding and
understanding information. With a dig at the much discussed information architecture
problems of iTunes along the way. This section sets things up well and goes through
thins in a comprehensible way without ever getting too technical - even managers can
read this. And they probably should.

Part 2 looks at the principles you need to understand: organising, labelling, navigation
and searching. Each chapter takes you through a topic, introducing it and then looking
at solutions. I found the sections on navigation and searching to be particularly good,
helped immensely by the full colour screenshots of web pages (many of them already
familiar and widely used) that appear throughout out the book. The final chapter in
this part looks deeper at semantic issues and touches on metadata, a topic that I think
that there is much more to be said about than is included here. One of the worst
aspects of most websites is their lack of support for machine readable metadata
schemes (like dublin core or open graph) and there is nothing here to promote them
which is unfortunate.

The final part looks at pulling all this together and how you design and build an
Information Architecture for a business. This covers research (with lots of emphasis on
looking at real users), getting buy in, making a strategy and then how to document it
all  effectively. All of this is at a high level - the book is not recommending specific
tools or techniques, but that is not significant as it is easy ti apply the ideas to
particular work environments and practices.

This is still the best book available on the subject and if I were teaching a course on
Information Architecture I would certainly recommend this as the supporting
textbook, and would structure my course in a similar fashion to the it.
