One of O'Reilly's excellent "red" series of database books, this is a comprehensive primer on using both MySQL (now owned by Oracle) and MariaDB. MariaDB is a community effort started by MySQL's original creator Monty Widenius, who also supplies a foreword for the book.

The book is divided into 5 main sections, covering:

 * Basic installation and use of the software
 * Creating and altering tables
 * Inserts, selects, updates and joins
 * Built in functions and administering MySQL. This final section also very briefly covers the C, Perl, Python, PHP and Ruby APIs.

I can imagine this being a useful book for a junior dev to pick up and work through near the start of their career. It is aimed at folks with no previous experience of MySQL, but the coverage is detailed enough that it would probably also suit people who have worked on another RDBMS and wanted a quick introduction to how things are done in the MySQL world.

At 370 pages, this book is clearly less comprehensive than Paul DuBois's MySQL Developer's Library (aka "the purple MySQL book"), which is one of the best MySQL references I have encountered. However, that may be no bad thing if what you are after is "just" a primer rather than something more comprehensive. Shorter books have the advantage of what some media people call "finishability". Being able to get to the end has a powerful motivational effect on many readers.[^motivational-effect]

As well as being concise, Dyer writes accurately and accessibly. Importantly, he covers pretty much all of the basics. Also, he takes time to at explain the motivation behind the examples in the text, of which there are plenty.

Each of the 16 chapters ends with a series of exercises, giving you a chance to practise some of the material covered in that chapter, an approach which should help cement your learning. The exercises seemed straightforward enough to me, mostly taking the form of practising using syntax covered in the text rather than requiring any great leaps of insight.

There are decent links to further resources at various places during the book -- notably in the very brief chapters covering the various APIs whih you can use to talk to MySQL.

There are a small number of areas which may have been useful to include - the different types of tables (InnoDB, MyISAM, etc.), and sorting out collation and character encoding, for example. But overall I felt that there was enough material in enogh detail to make this a useful read. If you haven't worked with MySQL or if you want a solid tutorial for a new developer, then Learning MySQL and MariaDB would be a good choice of book to start off with.
