# You don't know JS: ES6 and Beyond

## Charlie Harvey

Now that JavaScript has become the defacto virtual machine of the web and modern browsers make up a significant part of the market, it is both desirable and possible for the language to develop further. Hence the finalization of the [ECMAScript 6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/ECMA-262.pdf) in June 2015. And hence also a crop of books, this one included, covering the new language features.

The "You don&#8217;t know JS" series is intended to cover JavaScript comprehensively and deeply &mdash; a sort of inverse of Douglas Crockford&#8217;s "JavaScript: the good parts" it sets out to cover all the parts, good, bad or otherwise. In the words of the [series preface](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/preface.md):[^series-preface]

> JavaScript is awesome. It's easy to learn partially, and much harder to learn completely (or even sufficiently). When developers encounter confusion, they usually blame the language instead of their lack of understanding. These books aim to fix that, inspiring a strong appreciation for the language you can now, and should, deeply know.

The entire series was [crowdfunded on kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getify/you-dont-know-js-book-series) and the [draft manuscripts](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/README.md#you-dont-know-js-book-series)[^draft-manuscripts] are available to read free (as in beer) on github.  This more open, though not quite free/open source, approach to publishing is a good model for how publishing might work in the future. You gauge that an audience exists and cover some costs with a crowdfunder; you build an audience, spot the errors and act fairly by letting everyone see the content at no cost online; and then you make some profit on sales of a printed book.

The book covers a lot of material and is pitched at a reasonably high level. Perhaps the latter fact can be attributed to this being the last book in the series. It is certainly the case that the text refers frequently to earlier books where more in depth explanations of language features can be found.

The content is arranged into thematic chapters covering the current and future situation of ES6 (browser support, transpilers and so on); new syntax (block scoped declarations at last), organization of code (classes, modules, iterators and generators), async flow control and promises, collections, new API features, meta-programming, and some future-gazing in a chapter called "Beyond ES6".

Simpson is not afraid to be opinionated or to say when he feels that the design might be better. His code examples are short and to the point, though on occasions I might have appreciated more of a walkthrough in the text. Its tricky to evaluate JavaScript in ones head, especially when new language features were being demonstrated.

Clearly this is not the book for you if you want to "Learn JavaScript in N hours/days"; it is aimed at those who want to understand the whole language deeply and it is certainly comprehensive. Indeed, this volume could function as much as a reference as a tutorial. If your job involves more than a few hours a day of JavaScript wrangling or if you are deeply unsatisfied that most of your JavaScript programming consists of cut and pasting JQuery that you found on StackOverflow then the "You Don't Know" series should be on your reading list.
