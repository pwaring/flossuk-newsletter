# From the Editor

As reported in the September 2015 newsletter, FLOSS UK have moved to an annual
printed newsletter, supplemented by book reviews and event reports which will
be published on the website throughout the year. This is the first newsletter
to be published under the new format, which allows us to use colour and
include photographs.

Archives of old newsletters remain available on [flossuk.org](http://www.flossuk.org)
(from 2010) and [ukuug.org](http://www.ukuug.org) (1992-2010).

If you have any comments on the new format, please do get in touch via email:
[newsletter@flossuk.org](mailto:newsletter@flossuk.org).
