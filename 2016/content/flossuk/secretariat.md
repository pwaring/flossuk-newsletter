# From the Secretariat

Thank you to all the members who have paid their subscription invoice promptly
this year.  We have recently chased the outstanding subscriptions and hope the
remaining payments will come in promptly.

The Perl tutorials, held week beginning 8th February, again got very high marks
from all who attended.  The feedback on the questionnaires show that the Perl
tutorials are always very well received by our membership.

The recent Spring Workshops and Conference, held in London from 15th - 17th March,
although having a reduced number of delegates, was very successful and there are
write ups on the event and photographs later in this Newsletter.

The event was kindly sponsored by Google, Chef, Eligo Recruitment and our Sponsor
members SUSE and 2nd Quadrant Ltd.

Our next event is the BarCamp. This annual event is again being held in
Birmingham.

Please note our Annual General Meeting will be held in London on Wednesday 21st
September.

We shall be hoping to fill some vacant places on Council at the AGM but if you are
interested in joining Council now please let us know as we have the option to
co-opt members now.

As previously advised this is the only hard copy Newsletter being printed in 2016.
Future announcements, book reviews etc. will all appear on our new look web site.
